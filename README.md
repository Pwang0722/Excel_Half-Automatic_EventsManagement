### ï¼­ethod 
- To avoid accidentally modifying the template worksheets, they will be protected with a password every time the workbook is opened or closed.
  
Formula example:
  ```bash
Private Sub Workbook_Open()
    ProtectSheets
End Sub

Private Sub Workbook_BeforeClose(Cancel As Boolean)
    ProtectSheets
End Sub

Private Sub Workbook_SheetSelectionChange(ByVal Sh As Object, ByVal Target As Range)
    Dim protectedSheets As Variant
    Dim ws As Worksheet
    Dim password As String
    
    ' List of sheets to protect
    protectedSheets = Array("TEMPLATE_ALL", "Audio Out-House", "Summary", "HOLIDAYS")
    
    ' Check if the changed sheet is one of the protected sheets
    On Error Resume Next
    Set ws = ThisWorkbook.Sheets(Target.Worksheet.Name)
    On Error GoTo 0
    
    If Not ws Is Nothing And IsInArray(ws.Name, protectedSheets) Then
        ' Check if the sheet is protected
        If ws.ProtectContents Then
            ' Prompt the user to enter the password to unprotect the sheet
            password = InputBox("Enter the password to unprotect the sheet:", "Password")
            
            ' Check if the entered password matches the preset password
            If password = "1234" Then
                ' Unprotect the sheet to allow editing
                ws.Unprotect password:="1234"
            Else
                MsgBox "Incorrect password. The sheet will remain protected.", vbExclamation
                Application.EnableEvents = False
                Target.Offset(1, 0).Select ' Move to the next cell to avoid an infinite loop
                Application.EnableEvents = True
            End If
        End If
    End If
End Sub

Private Sub ProtectSheets()
    Dim protectedSheets As Variant
    Dim ws As Worksheet
    
    ' List of sheets to protect
    protectedSheets = Array("TEMPLATE_ALL", "Audio Out-House", "Summary", "HOLIDAYS")
    
    ' Loop through each protected sheet and protect with the preset password
    For Each sheetName In protectedSheets
        On Error Resume Next
        Set ws = ThisWorkbook.Sheets(sheetName)
        On Error GoTo 0
        
        If Not ws Is Nothing Then
            ws.Protect password:="1234", UserInterfaceOnly:=True
        End If
    Next sheetName
End Sub

Function IsInArray(val As Variant, arr As Variant) As Boolean
    IsInArray = (UBound(Filter(arr, val)) > -1)
End Function
  ```
